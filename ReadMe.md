## **Art Party:**

"Hi there, we run a busy venue and we've been managing guest registrations using paper forms, which is quite cumbersome and not very efficient. We're looking to upgrade to a digital solution and need your help to develop a simple application for this.

**What We Need:**

1. **Easy Registration for Guests:**
    - When guests come in, we want them to use the app to give us their name and contact details. It should be straightforward and quick so they don't have to wait too long. We'd also like an optional field where they can tell us why they're visiting, but it's not a must.

2. **Making Sure the Details are Right:**
    - The app should check if they've put in their details correctly. Like, their email should look like an email, and their phone number should be the right length.

3. **Keeping Track of Guests:**
    - Once they submit their info, it needs to be saved somewhere safe – that’s where the database comes in. We want to make sure that this information is stored securely and can be accessed later.

4. **Letting Guests Know It Worked:**
    - After they put in their details, the app should tell them everything's good to go, or if something’s wrong (like they forgot to fill in a field), it should tell them what to fix.

5. **We Need to See Who’s Registered:**
    - On our end, we need a way to see who’s come in. A list or something where we can see all the guest details would be great. It would help if we can search through it too.


**A Little Extra:**
- If possible, could we also have a way to edit or remove someone's details from the system? Just in case we need to update something or if someone asks us to delete their information. But this should only be something we can do, not the guests.
